### Hey there ðŸ‘‹
I mainly do backend programming (C#, Lua, Nodejs, etc) but sometimes, I touch html, frontend-js, css and their frameworks and make awful UIs. <br>
Nowadays I usually do [CFX.re](https://github.com/citizenfx) stuff, or some node.js projects like [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron). <br>
