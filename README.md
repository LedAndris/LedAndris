I mainly do backend programming (C#, Lua, Nodejs with TypeScript, etc) but sometimes,I touch React and make awful UIs. <br>
Nowadays I usually do web development with React and Express. <br>

All my relevant experience: <br>
-React <br>
-JavaScript <br>

-Express <br>
-HTML/CSS <br>
-Node.js <br>
-jQuery (I'm not sure if I'm proud of that) <br>

-JSON documents as database <br>
-Bunch of other useless frameworks <br>
-Managing applications at scale <br>

I'm mainly involved in the FiveM community, I usually help with projects around it, or run my own ones.
