### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I honestly have no idea how did you get here, but have fun getting through my shitcodes <3 <br>
I mainly do backend programming (C#, Lua, Nodejs, etc) but sometimes, I touch html, frontend-js, css and their frameworks. <br>
Nowadays I usually do [CFX.re](https://github.com/citizenfx) stuff, because I really enjoy making, and using them on my servers.
